## LEED Compliance from XML file

### 1. Parse GBXML file into honeybee object
Useful docs: http://gbxml.org/schema_doc/6.01/GreenBuildingXML_Ver6.01.html

### 2. IEQc: 8.1 Daylight and Views – Daylight
Demonstrate through computer simulation that the applicable spaces achieve daylight
illuminance levels of a minimum of 10 footcandles (fc) (110 Lux) and a maximum of 500 fc
(5,400 Lux) in a clear sky condition on September 21 at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.; areas
Provide glare control devices to avoid high-contrast situations that could impede visual
tasks. However, designs that incorporate view-preserving automated shades for glare
control may demonstrate compliance for only the minimum 10 fc (110 lux) illuminance level. 
### 3. IEQc 8.2 Daylight and Views – View 
Achieve a direct line of sight to the outdoor environment via vision glazing between 30 inches
and 90 inches (between 0.8 meters and 2.3 meters) above the finish floor for building
occupants in 90% of all regularly occupied areas. Determine the area with direct line of sight by
totaling the regularly occupied floor area that meets the following criteria:
* In plan view, the area is within sight lines drawn from perimeter vision glazing.
* In section view, a direct sight line can be drawn from the area to perimeter vision glazing.

The line of sight may be drawn through interior glazing. For private offices, the entirefloor area
of the office may be counted if 75% or more of the area has a direct line of sight to perimeter
vision glazing. For multioccupant spaces, the actual floor area with a direct line of sight to
perimeter vision glazing is counted.
The core and shell design must incorporate a feasible tenant layout(s) per the default
occupancy counts (or some other justifiable occupancy count) that can be used in the analysis
of this credit.
